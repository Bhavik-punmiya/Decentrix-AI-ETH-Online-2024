# Decentrix.ai - ETH online 2024

Here's what our team is working on so far:

**Name**: Decentrix.ai

**Description**: Decentrix is a pool of multi chains AI agents that will help developers to build on any chain using natural language and minimal coding.

**Idea**: our idea is to make multi chains AI agents, for example, an agent for rootstock chain, and using that agent user can make contracts, deploy them and do many chain specific cool stuff, all he needs to do is just ask the agent in natural language.
( with a "please" ofc :))

**Blockers**: We need to figure out our algorithm, which will use weighted randomness using pyth random number generator, which will make sure that even when the polls will be shown as per the amount of stake, but still there will be chances of lower stake polls to be included. so we needed help in that.
